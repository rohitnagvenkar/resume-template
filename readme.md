A single page one column resume for software developers, internship postitions and more. 
It uses the base latex templates and fonts to provide ease of use and installation when trying to update the resume. 
The different sections are clearly documented and custom commands are used to provide consistent formatting. 
The main sections in the resume are summary, education, skills, experience projects, work experience, interests.

### Motivation
I created this as an opportunity to learn LateX, steep learning curve but I can understand now why people prefer LateX,
over google docs or word.

### Newbies of LateX
The code is easy to understand and I have made an effort to comment sections so it is easy to look at and not get flusted,
at first sight, don't be afraid to take the first step.

### LateX Program
I am using TeXworks to edit and create these latex files, (http://www.tug.org/texworks/), 
use whichever software that suits your needs.
